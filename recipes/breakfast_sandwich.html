        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>A sandwich with all the staples of breakfast.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients List</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>8 slices of maple-cured bacon</li>
                <li>7 eggs</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>4 slices of bread</li>
                <li>5 tablespoons of oil, or as needed</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of maple syrup, or to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Lay bacon strips in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minuts. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.</li>
                <li>Beat 3 eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a large, shallow bowl. Dip each slice of bread into egg mixture to saturate completely.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook bread slices in hot oil, turning once, until browned on each side, about 5 minutes. Transfer toast to plate.</li>
                <li>Beat remaining eggs in a bowl. Cook and stir eggs in the same skillet over medium hat until eggs are scrambled and set, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Place 1 slice of toast on a plate and top with 1.2 of the bacon, 1/2 of the scrambled eggs, and 1 slice of toast. Repeat with remaining toast, bacon, and eggs. Top each sandwich with maple syrup.</li>
            </ol>
